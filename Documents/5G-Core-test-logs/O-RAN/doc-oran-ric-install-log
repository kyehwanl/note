Installation Release I - Non Realtime RIC
============================================
(https://wiki.o-ran-sc.org/display/RICNR/Release+I+-+Run+in+Kubernetes)


1. Prerequisites
----------------
  kubernetes v1.19 +
  docker and docker-compose (latest)
  git
  Text editor, e.g. vi, notepad, nano, etc.
  helm
  helm3

	--> their script to install kubernetes was not working well, 
		so, I uesed my own rke2 install script (install-docker-kubernetes-rke2.sh)
		(https://github.com/kyehwanl/note/blob/master/Shell_Script/install-docker-kubernetes-rke2.sh)

  ChartMuseum to store the HELM charts on the server, multiple options are available:

	> Execute the install script:

	./dep/smo-install/scripts/layer-0/0-setup-charts-museum.sh

   	> Install chartmuseum manually on port 18080 (https://chartmuseum.com/#Instructions, https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum)
