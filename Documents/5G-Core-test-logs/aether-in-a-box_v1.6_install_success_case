How to successfully install Aether-in-a-box version 1.6
=======================================================


1. Andy(ONF)'s email 

	I am working on a patch to aether-in-a-box to freeze the version of onos-operator to 0.4.14.  
	In the meantime you can make this change to the "configs/latest" file:

	ONOS_OPERATOR_CHART := onosproject/onos-operator --version 0.4.14

	Then youâ€™ll need to remove the broken chart:

	$ helm -n kube-system delete onos-operator

	After that, "CHARTS=latest make roc-5g-models" should work.



  	- open and modify "configs/latest" file,
		ONOS_OPERATOR_CHART := onosproject/onos-operator --version 0.4.14



2. in root account
    - go to "aether-in-a-box" folder
    - CHARTS=latest make roc-5g-models


3. make 5g-test, NOT with "CHARTS=latest"




4. Following is the description after successfully installed 'roc-5g-models'

	Thank you for installing aether-roc-umbrella Helm chart.

	Your release is named aether-roc-umbrella in namespace aether-roc.
	See https://docs.onosproject.org/developers/deploy_with_helm/

	To learn more about the release, try:
	  $ helm -n aether-roc status aether-roc-umbrella
	  $ helm -n aether-roc get all aether-roc-umbrella
	  $ watch kubectl -n aether-roc get pods

	You can attach to:
	* Aether CLI pod with
	$ kubectl -n aether-roc exec -it $(kubectl -n aether-roc get pods -l type=cli -o name) -- /bin/sh
	* Aether Portal at http://<server_IP>:31190

	If you are using KinD as a Kubernetes server, you will have to use a "port-forward" to access the Aether ROC GUI e.g.
	$ kubectl -n aether-roc port-forward service/aether-roc-gui 8183:80
	and then access the GUI at
	* http://localhost:8183

	The aether-roc-api is then available at http://localhost:8183/aether-roc-api





5.  The commands described above in 4
	  
	$ helm -n aether-roc status aether-roc-umbrella
		--> the result are the same with 4's description


	$ helm -n aether-roc get all aether-roc-umbrella
		--> all settings
