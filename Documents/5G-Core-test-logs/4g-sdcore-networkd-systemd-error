1. Error

    FATAL: Could not find systemd-networkd config for interface $(DATA_IFACE), exiting now!; exit 1 


2. Reason

    in Aether, 4g or 5g sdcore only install with the following command needs to use systemd-networkd instead of NetworkManager
         ENABLE_OAISIM=false DATA_IFACE=ens160 CHARTS=latest make 4g-core (Or 5g-core)


    - Ubuntu Desktop distribution uses NetworkManager as a default network configuration, 
    - Ubuntu Server distribution uses systemd-networkd as a default network configuration.


    Because Aether makefile tries to verify this with the script, 

       DATA_IFACE_PATH := $(shell find /*/systemd/network -maxdepth 1 -not -type d -name '*$(DATA_IFACE).network' -print) 
       DATA_IFACE_CONF ?= $(shell basename $(DATA_IFACE_PATH)).d 
    

	 If there is no *.network file in /etc/systemd/network/ or /run/systemd/network/ directories,
	  then, the error message above will be printed out and exit the make process.



3. Solution

(1) Convert NetworkManager to systemd-networkd 
https://www.xmodulo.com/switch-from-networkmanager-to-systemd-networkd.html
https://linux.fernandocejas.com/docs/how-to/switch-from-network-manager-to-systemd-networkd


  A. 
	As a first step let’s disable Network Manager service and enable systemd-networkd service:
	$ sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
	$ sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager
	$ sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd 


  B. 
	As a second step, we have to enable and start systemd-resolved service, 
	which is used by systemd-networkd for network name resolution. This service implements a caching DNS server.

	$ sudo systemctl enable systemd-resolved
	$ sudo systemctl start systemd-resolved

	Systemd-resolved will create its own resolv.conf under /run/systemd directory. 
	However, it is a common practise to store DNS resolver information in /etc/resolv.conf, 
	and many applications still rely on /etc/resolv.conf. 
	That is why we have to create a symlink to /etc/resolv.conf for compatibility reasons:

	$ sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
	$ sudo ln -s /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf


  C. Setting up network connections¶
	Network configuration information are represented by text files with .network extension in the directory /etc/systemd/network

	$ sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/network

	$ sudo touch /etc/systemd/network/10-netplan-ens160.network
	$ sudo touch /etc/systemd/network/20-netplan-ens192.network

	  < 10-netplan-ens160.network >
	  [Match]
	  Name=ens160

	  [Network]
	  LinkLocalAddressing=ipv6
	  Address=10.0.50.62/24
	  Gateway=10.0.50.200
	  DNS=10.0.50.200
	  Domains=antd.nist.gov nist.gov



	  < 20-netplan-ens192.network >
	  [Match]
	  Name=ens192

	  [Network]
	  LinkLocalAddressing=ipv6
	  Address=192.168.11.62/24
	  Gateway=192.168.11.1
	  DNS=192.168.11.1
	  Domains=antd.nist.gov nist.gov



  D. Restarting the service
	$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
