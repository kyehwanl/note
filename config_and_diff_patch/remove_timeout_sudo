Remove Timeout from using sudo 
==============================

1. sudo visudo or edit vim /etc/sudoers


2. add this line to somewhere inside  (AFTER sudo group rule)

    kyehwanl        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

	(https://askubuntu.com/questions/100051/why-is-sudoers-nopasswd-option-not-working)
	You should put that line after the line with the rule for the sudo group, because, as the sudoers man page states:

	  When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order.
	 Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not
	 necessarily the most specific match).
