1. Change to EST 
	$ sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York

2. To verify the change, invoke the timedatectl command again:

	$ timedatectl
							Local time: Tue 2019-12-03 13:55:09 EST
						Universal time: Tue 2019-12-03 18:55:09 UTC
							  RTC time: Tue 2019-12-03 18:02:16
							 Time zone: America/New_York (EST, -0500)
			 System clock synchronized: no
	  systemd-timesyncd.service active: yes
					   RTC in local TZ: no

3. 
Changing the Time Zone by Creating a Symlink
If you are running an older Linux distribution and the timedatectl utility is not present on your system, 
you can change the timezone by symlinking /etc/localtime to the time zone in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory.
