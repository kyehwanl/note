** ssh tunnel & sync gowork from vmwware-005 to a virtualbox image **
=====================================================================


1. make ssh tunnel
    [kyehwanl@localhost ~]$ ssh -fNL12345:vmware-005.antd.nist.gov:22 bgpsec1.antd.nist.gov


2. sync with rsync
    [kyehwanl@localhost ~]$ rsync -avPuiz -e "ssh -p 12345" localhost:/opt/project/gobgp_test/gowork/src/github.com/osrg/gobgp ~/project/gowork/src/github.com/osrg/




** Double ssh tunneling ** 
===========================
SSH Tunnel from Macbook's virtualbox image to Macbook(toadyoon), and then ssh-tunneling from Macbook to NIST laptop, and then connect BGPSEC1 inside ANTD net


(Step 1) SSH Remote Tunneling  from Windows 7 laptop(NIST) to Macbook 
 - because NIST laptos has Windows OS, so need to Remote SSH tunneling
 - in SecureCRT's Remote Port Forwarding Properties, 
     -- Remote Port 12345
     -- Local Hostname : bgpsec1.antd.nist.gov
     -- check the box, 'Destination host is different from localhost'
     -- port 22

    -> these means, -R12345:bgpsec1.antd.nist.gov:22 192.168.1.121(Macbook ip address)


 (Step 2) Open terminal on Macbook and connect to Virtualbox Fedora guest os
  - connect to Fedora guest os on Virtualbox, 
    -- ssh -p 2222 kyehwanl@192.168.56.1   ( 2222: port forwarding setting, 192.168.56.1: guest os's ip address) 

  - from guest OS, make a local ssh tunnel to Macbook
    -- ssh -fNL12346:localhost:12345 toadyoon@192.168.1.121 (where, localhost connection will be redirected to BGPSEC1)


 (Step 3) from guest OS to NIST BGPSEC1
  - using guest os's local ssh tunnel, it will be able to connect to localhost:12345, 
    which was configured previously to connect to BGPSEC1 in NIST with ssh Remote tunnel

    -- ssh -p 12346 localhost


        (at Guest OS, Fedora, user:kyehwanl, hostname: localhost)
        [kyehwanl@localhost ~]$ ssh -fNL12346:localhost:12345 toadyoon@192.168.1.121
        Password:

        [kyehwanl@localhost ~]$ ssh -p 12346 localhost

 SSH tunnel to ANTD servers From Windows 10 NIST VPN
=====================================================
(http://woshub.com/ssh-tunnel-port-forward-windows/)

1. in Windows 10 console, in order to make ssh tunnel

    Z:\>ssh kyehwanl@access.antd.nist.gov -L 13389:vmware-011.antd.nist.gov:3389
