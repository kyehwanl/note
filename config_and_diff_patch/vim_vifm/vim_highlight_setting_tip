2. p4 Editing
=============
(https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide/blob/master/README-editor-support.md)

(1) vim

  Vim color highlighting and auto-indenting
  To change the mode for the current file being edited:

  :set syntax=c RET
  To cause all files with a suffix of .p4 in their file name to automatically use C/C++ mode when loaded, add lines like the following in your $HOME/.vimrc file:

  augroup filetypedetect
    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.p4 setfiletype c
    " associate *.p4 with c filetype
  augroup END


(2) cscope & ctags

  (2.1) cscope
     find . -name '*.p4' -o -name '*.h' > cscope.files
     cscope -bk


  (2.2) ctags
    To create a TAGS file for use with Emacs, for all source files with a .p4 or .h suffix in the current directory 
    and all sub-directories, use this command:

    ctags-exuberant -e -R

    Remove the '-e' command line option if you want to generate a 'tags' file for Vim.

    You can also give an explicit list of file names instead of the -R option,
    if there are some files you do not wish to include. The following command achieves a similar
    effect as the one above, but may be more easily modified to include or exclude the files you want:

    find . -name '*.p4' -o -name '*.h' | xargs ctags-exuberant -e
