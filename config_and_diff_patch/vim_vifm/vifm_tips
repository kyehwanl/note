Ctrl+w followed by HJKL (uppercase):
    moves the current split to the farthest possible location in the respective direction

    (for example) when vertically splitted windows, go to the right window (with ctrl+w l) 
                  and then, Ctrl+w J, makes the right side window be placed at the bottom
