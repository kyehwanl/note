Vagrant Errors and Issues
==========================


1. When boot up or load the saved snapshot, if following "headless" error occurs,

    Command: ["startvm", "ee98ae13-5b96-46fd-8d5b-2545eaa11c87", "--type", "headless"]   

    OR
    
    Often vboxnet is not being used for a while, the network interface has gone


(Solution)
    go to VBoxManager in GUI, completely purge or remove the image and try to restart all again
    
    or 

    try to create again,
    sudo vboxmanage hostonlyif ipconfig vboxnet0 --ip 192.168.10.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0
