using ssh-keygen
----------------------------


The algorithm is selected using the -t option and key size using the -b option. The following commands illustrate:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
ssh-keygen -t dsa 
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

Generating Public and Private Keys with openssl.exe
----------------------------------------------------
(http://lunar.lyris.com/help/Content/generating_public_and_private_keys.html)
To perform the following actions for Windows or Linux, you must have OpenSSL installed on your system.

 
Generating the Private Key -- Linux

  1. Open the Terminal.
  2. Navigate to the folder with the ListManager directory.
  3. Type the following:
     openssl genrsa -out rsa.private 1024

  4. Press ENTER. The private key is generated and saved in a file named "rsa.private" located in the same folder.

 

Generating the Public Key -- Linux

  1. Open the Terminal.
  2. Type the following:
    openssl rsa -in rsa.private -out rsa.public -pubout -outform PEM
 
  3. Press ENTER. The public key is saved in a file named rsa.public located in the same folder.



Generating the Private Key -- Windows

  In Windows:

  1. Open the Command Prompt (Start > Programs > Accessories > Command Prompt).
  2. Navigate to the following folder:
       C:\Program Files\ListManager\tclweb\bin\certs

  3. Type the following:
      openssl genrsa -out rsa.private 1024

  4. Press ENTER. The private key is generated and saved in a file named "rsa.private" located in the same folder.

      NOTE The number "1024" in the above command indicates the size of the private key. You can choose one of five sizes: 512, 758, 1024, 1536 or 2048 (these numbers represent bits). The larger sizes offer greater security, but this is offset by a penalty in CPU performance. We recommend the best practice size of 1024.

   

Generating the Public Key -- Windows

 
  1. At the command prompt, type the following:
      openssl rsa -in rsa.private -out rsa.public -pubout -outform PEM

  2. Press ENTER. The public key is saved in a file named rsa.public located in the same folder.
