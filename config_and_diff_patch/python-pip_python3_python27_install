(https://www.2daygeek.com/3-methods-to-install-latest-python3-package-on-centos-6-system/)

    Using EPEL Repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)
    EPEL stands for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux maintained by Fedora Special Interest Group.
    They creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, 
    including, but not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL), Oracle Linux (OL).
    EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or 
    replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions.
    EPEL package is included in the CentOS Extras repository and enabled by default so, we can install 
    this by running below command.


    # yum install epel-release
    Check the available python 3 version.

    # yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="epel" info python34
