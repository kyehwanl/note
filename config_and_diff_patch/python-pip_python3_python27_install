Installation or Upgrade python3
===============================
(https://www.2daygeek.com/3-methods-to-install-latest-python3-package-on-centos-6-system/)

    Using EPEL Repository (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)
    EPEL stands for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux maintained by Fedora Special Interest Group.
    They creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, 
    including, but not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL), Oracle Linux (OL).
    EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or 
    replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions.
    EPEL package is included in the CentOS Extras repository and enabled by default so, we can install 
    this by running below command.


    # yum install epel-release
    Check the available python 3 version.

    # yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="epel" info python34

    Summary     : Version 3 of the Python programming language aka Python 3000
    URL         : http://www.python.org/
    License     : Python
    Description : Python 3 is a new version of the language that is incompatible with the 2.x
                : line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
                : how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
                : considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed.

    Run the below command to install latest available python 3 package from EPEL repository.


    # yum --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="epel" install python34
    By default this will not install matching pip & setuptools and we have to install by running below command.

    # curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

    Run the below command to check installed python3 version.

    # python3 --version
    Python 3.4.5





python 2.7 Install and pip
==========================

1. Download 
    # cd /usr/src
    # wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.16/Python-2.7.16.tgz
    # tar xzf Python-2.7.16.tgz


2. Install

    Now run the following commands to compile Python 2.7 and install on your system using altinstall.

    # cd Python-2.7.16
    # ./configure --enable-optimizations
    # make altinstall

    make altinstall is used to prevent replacing the default python binary file /usr/bin/python


3. Check Python Version
    Check the latest version installed of python using below command. 
    During this installation, the latest Python binary was installed on path /usr/local/bin/python2.7. 
    The existing binary was located under /usr/bin.

    # /usr/local/bin/python2.7 -V

    Python 2.7.16


    Warning: Do not overwrite or link the original Python binary, This may damage your system.


4. Install PIP
    PIP is a useful utility to install and manage Python modules. 
    Let’s install the PIP for the installed Python version.

    # curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
    # python2.7 get-pip.py



  4.1 Error 'Unable to locate package python-pip' on ubuntu 20
    
    <Reason> 
        Pip for Python 2 is not included in the Ubuntu 20.04 repositories.
        You need to install pip for Python 2 using the get-pip.py script.


    <Solution>

        1. Start by enabling the universe repository:

            sudo add-apt-repository universe

        2. Update the packages index and install Python 2:

            sudo apt update 
            sudo apt install python2

        3. Use curl to download the get-pip.py script:

            curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py
      
        4. Once the repository is enabled, run the script as sudo user with python2 to install pip :

            sudo python2 get-pip.py
      

            If an error occurs, as a fallback, the specific 2.7 version of get-pip.py can be used:

            curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py
      
    Pip will be installed globally. If you want to install it only for your user, run the command without sudo. 
    The script will also install setuptools and wheel, which allow you to install source distributions

      Verify the installation by printing the pip version number:

            pip2 --version
   
      The output will look something like this:

           pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pip (python 2.7)
