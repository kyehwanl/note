Docker Compose Tips
===================


1. depends_on
    depends_on expresses start order (and implicitly image pulling order), which was a good side effect of links.

    (example)
      version: "3.7"
      services:
        web:
          build: .
          depends_on:
            - db
            - redis
        redis:
          image: redis
        db:
          image: postgres



    if using 'depends_on' option,   
    it might be possible to get an order among generated docker instances for setting IP address ?? YES

    * 'build' can be used in the command "docker-compose build" (in this case, assume Dockerfile is in the current path)
    ** specific name and path can be specified

        image: srxsuite_src
        build:
            dockerfile: Dockerfile_srxsuite_src
            context: /opt/project/docker_test/



2. docker-compose rm | down
   : to remove docker instances (same as  "docker rm <container>" )

    (1) docker-compose rm
      vmware.011-antd [2000]{.../srx/compose_test}-> sudo docker-compose -f ./srx_test-compose.yml rm
      Going to remove node1, srx_server, node2                                                       
      Are you sure? [yN] y                                                                           
      Removing node1      ... done                                                                   
      Removing srx_server ... done                                                                   
      Removing node2      ... done

        ** docker-compose rm -fs 
            -f: Don't ask to confirm removal, 
            -s: Stop the containers, if required, before removing


    (2) docker-compose down:    
        - can stop and remove containers
        - But, it also stop/ remove sub-network 



3. docker-compose up

    vmware.011-antd [2002]{.../srx/compose_test}-> sudo docker-compose -f ./srx_test-compose.yml up 
    WARNING: The Docker Engine you're using is running in swarm mode.
          
    Compose does not use swarm mode to deploy services to multiple nodes in a swarm.
    All containers will be scheduled on the current node. 
    To deploy your application across the swarm, use `docker stack deploy`.
    
    Creating node1 ... done
    Creating srx_server ...
    Creating node1 ...
    Attaching to node2, srx_server, node1


    ** docker-compose up for only certain containers
    $ docker-compose up [-d] <client1> [[client2]...]  (-d: detached mode)
    $ docker-compose start <client1> [[client2]...] 
    
    start : assumes the container already exists and just starts it, 
    up    : will pull images if necessary, create containers if necessary, then start the container



4. joining same network on which docker-compose running 

    docker run -it --rm --net composetest_bgp_net --ip 172.27.0.101 centos bash


5. log
    docker-compose logs <name-of-service>
    
    <CAUTION> in order to use logs, docker-compose file's name should be "docker-compose.yml"


6. scale 
    same way as "replica" in swarm mode

    docker-compose up --scale quaggasrx=5 --scale gobgpsec=3


7. Docker Stack / Deploy
    In order to combine docker-compose file to swarm service
    (https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/)
    (https://codefresh.io/docker-tutorial/deploy-docker-compose-v3-swarm-mode-cluster/)
    
    $ docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml <image>
    OR
    
    $ docker deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml



    (1) in case docker stack deploy has error, "Pool overlaps with other one on this address space "
    
    --> docker system prune
