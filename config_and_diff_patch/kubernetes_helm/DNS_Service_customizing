How to remove "search" on resolv.conf in the pod

 -- DNS Service Customizing in Kubernetes -- 
=================================================

As we can read from Kubernetes dosc Customizing DNS Service:

	If a Pod’s dnsPolicy is set to “default”, it inherits the name resolution configuration from the node that the Pod runs on. 
	The Pod’s DNS resolution should behave the same as the node.

	If you don’t want this, or if you want a different DNS config for pods, 
	you can use the kubelet’s --resolv-conf flag. Set this flag to “” to prevent Pods from inheriting DNS. 
	Set it to a valid file path to specify a file other than /etc/resolv.conf for DNS inheritance.

As for Pod’s DNS Policy are as follows:

	DNS policies can be set on a per-pod basis. Currently Kubernetes supports the following pod-specific DNS policies. 
	These policies are specified in the dnsPolicy field of a Pod Spec.

	“Default“: The Pod inherits the name resolution configuration from the node that the pods run on. 
	“ClusterFirst“: Any DNS query that does not match the configured cluster domain suffix, such as “www.kubernetes.io”, 
		  is forwarded to the upstream nameserver inherited from the node. Cluster administrators may have extra stub-domain 
		  and upstream DNS servers configured. See related discussion for details on how DNS queries are handled in those cases.
	“ClusterFirstWithHostNet“: For Pods running with hostNetwork, you should explicitly set its DNS policy “ClusterFirstWithHostNet”.
	“None“: It allows a Pod to ignore DNS settings from the Kubernetes environment. 
		  All DNS settings are supposed to be provided using the dnsConfig field in the Pod Spec. 



The trick was I had to edit the /var/lib/kubelets/config.yaml on each node and then restart the pods





Bugs in Kubelet rke2 rancher
=============================

  - DNS Lookups for cluster-domain (and subdomains) of cluster don't work #2157
	https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/2157




In Host, remove search line
============================

(1) /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

	remove 'domain-search', 'host-name', related to search
