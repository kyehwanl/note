1. Error Message
  Firefox is already running, but is not responding. 
  To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system.


2. Solution

    The solution is to delete a hidden mysterious file called .parentlock. 
    This file is typically located under your home directory in the following location.

  
        cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/

    You should see a folder with some random name (yours will differ), followed by .default, for example: 06agjsjz.default

    Go into that folder:

        cd 06agjsjz.default

    There should be a file called .parentlock (itâ€™s hidden so type ls -a to see it). Delete it:

        rm .parentlock

    Start Firefox again and it should work!


3. My solution,

    delete all .parentlock in all folders from .mozilla/firefox/
