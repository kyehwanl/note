- system keeps changing my DNS to 127.0.0.53


The annoying thing here is that you basically have to "hack" either Network Manager or systemd-resolved to configure a custom DNS.

Here is a way to do it using a package called resolvconf. This package ensures that /etc/resolv.conf is updated with your custom DNS info.

Install:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install resolvconf
Check service is running: (if not enable and start)

$ sudo systemctl enable resolvconf.service
$ sudo systemctl start resolvconf.service
$ sudo systemctl status resolvconf.service
Edit config file:

$ sudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
Add the following lines: (your custom and Google for fallback)

nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
Save the file and restart the service:

$ sudo systemctl restart resolvconf.service
Check that your custom DNS have been added to /etc/resolv.conf:

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
