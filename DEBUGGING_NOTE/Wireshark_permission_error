Wireshark Errors
================

1. Couldn't run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission denied

(1) Solution

    * sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
        --> select Yes for non-root user to capture

    * sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/dumpcap
        --> permission clear
        
    you should now be able to run it without root and you will be able to capture.
