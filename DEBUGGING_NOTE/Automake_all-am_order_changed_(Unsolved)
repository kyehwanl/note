in Makefile, all-am orders
===========================

Centos 7, ubuntu 16, all-am build orders are below

    all-am: Makefile $(LIBRARIES) $(PROGRAMS) $(DATA) $(HEADERS) 

But, Centos 8, 

    all-am: Makefile $(PROGRAMS) $(LIBRARIES) $(DATA) $(HEADERS) 

    --> LIBRARIES and PROGRAMS are reversed



<issues>
    LIBRARIES has one library which has _DEPENDENCIES, it needs to run before PROGRAM build
    So, it will have some errors when PROGRAMS runs first.
