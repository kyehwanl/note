Resolution

    First check password aging policies/information for user as follows:

  # chage -l user 
  Last password change: Feb 07, 2011 
  Password expires: May 08, 2011 
  Password inactive: never 
  Account expires: never 
  Minimum number of days between password change: 7       <---
  Maximum number of days between password change: 90 
  Number of days of warning before password expires: 28


(1)
Make following changes to "/etc/shadow" file as root user:

user:$1$rmOPqlKQ$DMS2VsQuV/LNh8it5jT.N0:15012:0:99999:7:::     <---

OR

(2)
Expire the user's password using root account:

# chage -d 0 user



  * # chage -l user 
  Last password change: Feb 07, 2011 
  Password expires: May 08, 2011 
  Password inactive: never 
  Account expires: never 
  Minimum number of days between password change: 0    <--- 
  Maximum number of days between password change: 90 
  Number of days of warning before password expires: 28
   
  Try to change the password and it should work now.


Root Cause

    The issue mentioned above seems to be due to user password expiry settings are too restrictive.
    Minimum number of days between password change was set to 7 days so password change was not allowed before 7 days. 
	The error You must wait longer to change your password was suggesting the same.
