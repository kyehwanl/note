Kubernetes Running Errors
=========================

1. no matches for kind "Deployment" in version "apps/v1beta1"

    in this case, run following first,

    $ kubectl api-resources | grep deployment
    deployments                       deploy       apps                           true  


    that means, that only apiVersion with apps is correct for Deployments (extensions is not supporting Deployment). 
    The same situation with StatefulSet.

    You need to change Deployment and StatefulSet apiVersion to apiVersion: apps/v1.




2. kubectl bash completion doesn't work in ubuntu docker container

    (1) 
    bash completion happens to generate the following error messages
    it doesn't work within the docker container "bash: _get_comp_words_by_ref: command not found."


    (2) Solution
    Install using yum install -y bash-completion and then 
    source using source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh 
    followed by the actual command source <(kubectl completion bash)
