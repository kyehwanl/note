Kubernetes Running Errors
=========================

1. no matches for kind "Deployment" in version "apps/v1beta1"

    in this case, run following first,

    $ kubectl api-resources | grep deployment
    deployments                       deploy       apps                           true  


    that means, that only apiVersion with apps is correct for Deployments (extensions is not supporting Deployment). 
    The same situation with StatefulSet.

    You need to change Deployment and StatefulSet apiVersion to apiVersion: apps/v1.




2. kubectl bash completion doesn't work in ubuntu docker container

    (1) 
    bash completion happens to generate the following error messages
    it doesn't work within the docker container "bash: _get_comp_words_by_ref: command not found."


    (2) Solution
    Install using yum install -y bash-completion and then 
    source using source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh 
    followed by the actual command source <(kubectl completion bash)




3. docker change cgroup driver to systemd
(source:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43794169/docker-change-cgroup-driver-to-systemd)


    (1)
    errors:
    failed to run Kubelet: misconfiguration: kubelet cgroup driver: systemd is different from docker cgroup driver: cgroupfs


    (2)
    A solution that does not involve editing systemd units or drop-ins would be to create (or edit) the /etc/docker/daemon.json configuration file and to include the following:

    {
      "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
    }

    After saving it, restart your docker service.

    sudo systemctl restart docker
    This solution obviously is only feasible if you would want to apply this system-wide.


    -- OR --

   
    OS: Centos 7.4 As kubernetes 1.23.1 recommend to use cgroup systemd, and docker 20.10.20 use cgroup cgroupfs. 
    So, you have to change docker service file.

    step1: Stop docker service

    systemctl stop docker



    step2: change on files /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service and /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service

    From :

    ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
    TO:

    ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock --exec-opt native.cgroupdriver=systemd



    step3: start docker service and kubelet

    systemctl start docker
    kubeadm init phase kubelet-start
