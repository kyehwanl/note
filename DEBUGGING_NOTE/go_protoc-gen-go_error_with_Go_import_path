gRPC protocol buffer compilation issues
=======================================

(1) command
 $ protoc -I=. --go_out=plugins=grpc:. ./srx_grpc.proto


(2) error

    protoc-gen-go: unable to determine Go import path for "srx_grpc.proto"

    Please specify either:
            • a "go_package" option in the .proto source file, or
            • a "M" argument on the command line.

    See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go-generated#package for more information.

    --go_out: protoc-gen-go: Plugin failed with status code 1.


(3) Solution


    https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go-generated#package

    As the error says, you need to specify the import path of the Go package containing the .proto file. 
    The simplest way to do this is with a go_package option:

    option go_package = "example.com/package/name";

    The Go protocol buffer compiler has been printing a warning about missing import paths since v1.4.0 
    (released about a year ago), and stating that specifying the import path would eventually become a requirement. 
    v1.5.0 upgrades this warning to an error.


(4) My solution

    - in srx_grpc.proto, added following line
    
      option go_package = "./";

    Then, srx_grpc.pb.go file will be generated the current("./") directory
