1. issue

- When setup for nfs sharing, trying to cp or mv to the sharing directory, the following error occured
    "failed to preserve ownership for operation not permitted"

- BUT, it complains about can't preserve ownership but moves the file anyway, and keeps the ownership

- Interesting is 'mv' 'cp -a' (-a: --archive same as preserve=all) has a complaining error, 
  but 'cp' doesn't have any error



2. Reason
    - when setup nfs mount folder, 

        mkdir -p /mnt/mirror
        chown -R nobody:nogroup /mnt/mirror
        chmod 777 /mnt/mirror/

      in /etc/exports, 
        '/mnt/mirror 192.168.10.0/24(rw,sync)'

    a file or folder which has root permission won't be written here, because of "chwon nobody:nobody" nobody(=id:65534)


3. Solution

(1) possible solution
    -- change ownership might be one solution

        chown 1005:1005 <file>  (id:1005 appuser)
