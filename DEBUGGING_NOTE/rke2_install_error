When Install rke2 
==================


1. curl error

	curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | INSTALL_RKE2_CHANNEL=latest sh -

	[INFO]  finding release for channel latest
	curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, errno 104
	[INFO]  using latest as release
	[INFO]  downloading checksums at https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/latest/sha256sum-amd64.txt
	curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404 Not Found



  (Solution)
	stop firewall  --> systemctl stop ufw

	https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/623


	Do you need to run the installation through a proxy? Is your proxy or firewall blocking the conneciton? 
	It appears that you're not able to access the channel server:

	[INFO]  finding release for channel latest
	curl: (56) OpenSSL SSL_read: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, errno 104
	[INFO]  using latest as release

	Unfortunately latest is not a valid GitHub release, so it's not really a sane default. 
	Failure to look up the release should probably be a terminal error.
