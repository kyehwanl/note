1. Issues

- On Ubuntu 18,
- when Aether in a box installation
- following error occurred 

    (1)
      systemd-networkd: Could not load configuration files Permission denied

    or

    (2)
      Job for systemd-networkd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
      See "systemctl status systemd-networkd.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
      Makefile:283: recipe for target '/root/aether-in-a-box//build/milestones/router-pod' failed
      make: *** [/root/aether-in-a-box//build/milestones/router-pod] Error 1



2. Diagnosis 

    using systemctl status systemd-networkd  and journalctl -xe
    It turns out --> permission related error of the newly added .netdev, .network files



3. solution

    root@vmware-063:~/aether-in-a-box# ll /etc/systemd/network/   
    total 16                                                      
    drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug  5 19:33 ./                   
    drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Jan 28  2022 ../                  
    -rw-r----- 1 root root  121 Aug  5 19:33 10-aiab-dummy.netdev 
    -rw-r----- 1 root root  132 Aug  5 19:33 20-aiab-dummy.network 


    chmod 666 *
    then, try again. It worked
