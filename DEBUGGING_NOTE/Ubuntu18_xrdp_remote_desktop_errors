Ubuntu 18 Xrdp errors
======================


1. channel 3: open failed: connect failed: Connection refused

    1.1 cause: xrdp not exist
    --> solution: install xrdp


    1.2 Other reason: firewall
    --> disable or add a rule for remote connection
    
    



2. error message:

 "because of a security error the client not connect to the remote computer.
  Verify that you are logged on to the network..."


  2.1 cause : look into logs

    There is an error "etc/xrdp/key.pem: Permission denied"


    2.2 solution
    (https://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=13708)

    Option 1 – Change Permissions (Not the best option)
    I mention this option because I have seen a lot of people using it.  
    This was basically the easiest way to fix their issue at that moment.  
    Based on our analysis, the Others group has no access to the folders and file needed by xRDP.  
    So, by changing this and providing read only access to the resources should fix our issue.  
    As shown in the following two screenshots, from nautilus (started as admin), 
    we have changed the permissions on the folder and file located at /etc/ssl/private


    After that, try your xRDP connection and check again the /vart/log/xrdp.log file 
    and you should see that the warning/error is gone. 



    Option 2 – add user xrdp into ssl-cert group (BETTER solution) --> solved my problem !!

    This would be the recommended approach. 
    Updating the group membership for the ssl-cert group with the appropriate user account should fix the issue.   
    The information is not new as Martin Thiago (see this post) shared it already.  
    To fix this minor issue without changing file system permission, 
    you would simply need to add the user account called xrdp into the group called ssl-cert.  
    you can achieve this by executing the following command 

    sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert  

    With no more actions, 
    if you try to perform an xRDP login again, you will notice that the error is still generated 
    and logged in the /var/log/xrdp.log.  To ensure that the change fixes the issue, 
    you also need to restart the xrdp services or simply reboot the machine ensuring that the group memberhsip 
    is updated and the correct information is read by the system.  


    And then, restart xrdp and ssh 

    sudo service xrdp restart




3. xrdp session: Login failed for display 0

    3.1 cause: wrong id/ password
