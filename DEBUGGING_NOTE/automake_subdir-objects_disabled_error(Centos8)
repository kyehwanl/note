autoreconf: automake failed with exit status: 1


(Cause)
-------
in Centos 8, it occurs



(Solution)
-----------
(https://github.com/BitzenyCoreDevelopers/cpuminer/issues/5)


  There are 2 options to fix

  a) adding subdir-objects to configure.ac like this
  AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([gnu subdir-objects])

  b) adding AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = subdir-objects to Makefile.am
  AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = subdir-objects

in srx-server, configure.ac

-AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign])
+AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign subdir-objects])


in srx-server/src, configure.ac

-AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([-Wall -Werror -Wno-portability])
+AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([-Wall -Werror -Wno-portability foreign subdir-objects])
