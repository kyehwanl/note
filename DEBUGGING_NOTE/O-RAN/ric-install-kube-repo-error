  (https://docs.o-ran-sc.org/projects/o-ran-sc-ric-plt-ric-dep/en/latest/installation-guides.html#installing-near-realtime-ric-in-ric-cluster)


  there is git clone for downloading, 
  git clone "https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/ric-plt/ric-dep"

  in ric-dep/bin/install_k8s_and_helm.sh

    KUBEV=1.16.0

    this line related to the following line later,

    KUBEVERSION=1.16.0-00


    But, it will end up with 
    "./install_k8s_and_helm.sh: line 48: kubectl: command not found"

    or 

    The repository 'http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial Release' does not have a Release file
    ...
    Ign:6 https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt kubernetes-xenial InRelease
    Err:7 https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt kubernetes-xenial Release
    404 Not Found [IP: 142.251.42.46 443]


    Because of version not support anymore,

2. Solution

th the change to the new Kubernetes images repo, the installation steps are no longer backward compatible, 
and we have to be explicit about the desired version for the apt source file and gpg key.

To install components versioned 1.28.1 run the following:

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y kubeadm=1.28.1-1.1 kubelet=1.28.1-1.1 kubectl=1.28.1-1.1

To install components versioned 1.29.1 run the same commands but replace 28 with 29 for gpg key, apt source, and install.
