3. main cause

	Known issues,
	https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9134
	https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/9428


	--> somehow ubuntu 20 images didnt' include ifupdown


4. Solution

	(1) vagrant ssh into the machine and run:

	  sudo apt-get update
	  sudo apt-get install -y ifupdown

	  Exit out and run vagrant reload. 
	  Then, Network configured. A bit messy, but I guess it's doable for now.


5. Etc
	- happens < vagrant 2.0.2
	- vagrant v2.0.3 or higher version seems working fine (confirmed with v2.2.7)
