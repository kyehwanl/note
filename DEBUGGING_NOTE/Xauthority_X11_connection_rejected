 Solution
-------------
I don't quite know what solved the problem, so possible solutions are below


A. 
  (https://www.google.com/search?q=ssh+X11+connection+rejected+because+of+wrong+authentication&rlz=1C1GCEV_enUS1006US1006&oq=ssh+X11+connection+rejected+because+of+wrong+authentication+&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i7i30j0i5i30l2.5183j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on)

  1. Log onto remote server
  echo $DISPLAY This should display your current X11 display

  xauth list If nothing prints on console, it means ssh did not automatically generate the X11 authorization cookies on the local display properly

  2. Add the authorization cookie
  xauth add $DISPLAY -  `mcookie` This adds your display's authorization cookie to the xauth

  xauth list Check whether your display is added

  3. Merge your cookie with your local machine
  xauth nextract ~/xcookie $DISPLAY

  exit

  On local: scp user@remote:~/xcookie ~/xcookie

  On local: xauth nmerge ~/xcookie

  Finally log again in the remote server and it should be resolved.



B. using -X instead of -Y


C. reboot
