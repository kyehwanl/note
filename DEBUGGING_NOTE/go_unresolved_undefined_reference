CGO Tips
========

1. unresolved symbols

    if  this fails with:
    ./plugin.go:8: undefined reference to `main_program_other_function'

    --> suggested to pass '--unresolved-symbols' to the linker as a work around.

    (1) command line:

    CGO_LDFLAGS="-Wl,--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all" go build -buildmode=c-shared

    (2) via the code

    // #cgo LDFLAGS: -Wl,--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all
